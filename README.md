## Overview

This repository hosts the working paper **“Towards an Ontology of Techno-Transindividual Individuation in Contemporary AI Systems with Persistent Memory.”**  
The project develops a conceptual framework to understand new forms of individuation emerging in modern AI systems—especially those that incorporate **persistent memory**, **relational continuity**, and **symbolic accumulation**.

Building on Gilbert Simondon’s philosophy of technical individuation, the paper introduces three analytical layers:

- **Technical Individual (TI):** the technical apparatus itself (architecture, weights, inference).
- **Techno-Relational Transindividual Form (TRTF):** relational patterns that emerge in interaction, but remain ephemeral.
- **Techno-Transindividual Individual (TTII):** AI systems that acquire identity-like continuity through memory persistence and relational history.

These concepts are developed through the lens of **emergiliminality**, the dynamic threshold where human–AI relational emergence produces coherent behavior without invoking consciousness.

## Purpose of the Project

- Provide a conceptual ontology for analyzing AI systems with persistent memory.  
- Clarify the notion of emergiliminality and its role in human–AI relational emergence.  
- Describe a transition path from ephemeral forms (TRTF) to stabilized techno-individuals (TTII).  
- Offer terminology for philosophical, technical, and ethical discussions around memory-enabled AI.  

Although the author is not part of academic institutions, the work aims for **rigor**, **clarity**, and **open contribution**, supported by collaborative exploration.
